This explores a Machine Learning algorithm called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), it's a common Deep Learning technique used for continuous data pattern recognition. Recurrent Neural Network take into account how data changes over time, it's typically used for time-series data (stock prices, sensor readings, etc).
